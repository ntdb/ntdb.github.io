<p>In 2012 I worked with Caterpillar to develop an iPad application to educate customers about the various features of their new MineStar system. At Daniel, we took advantage of our established web application stack to develop an app that delivers a fluid and enjoyable experience available on the web and on company tablets.</p>

<p>The app features spinners for many pieces of Caterpillar machinery, both their exteriors and their interiors. To facilitate these spinners we developed a jQuery plugin that allows for spinning, panning, and zooming around 3D models in the browser. It is optimized for mobile devices and hosted it on GitHub.</p>
