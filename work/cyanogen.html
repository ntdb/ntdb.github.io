<p>In early 2015 I worked with designers at Cyanogen to develop a new website showcasing the strength and opportunity of the Cyanogen organization and their operating system. I leveraged Craft CMS to build a number of responsive frontend modules which allow Cyanogen's designers and content managers to describe their company and product accurately.</p>
