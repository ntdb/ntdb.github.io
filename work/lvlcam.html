<p>LVL CAM is the only (well... the best anyway) camera app for taking perfectly balanced and level shots on your iPhone.</p>

<p>LVL Cam is the product of a Daniel "app jam" done with our studio-mates at <a href="http://madebyallies.com/" target="_blank">ALLIES</a>. We designed, prototyped, tested, and refined the app over the course of two weeks before submitting it to the app store.</p>

<p>The original idea behind LVL Cam was to use the various sensors in the iPhone to take an image that is perfectly aligned with its target. By tracking the roll, pitch, and yaw of the phone the app can take excellently aligned top-down photographs, landscapes, selfies, and whatever else your instagramming heart desires.</p>

<p>I had the joy of whipping up a working prototype of the camera/sensor functionality in the first few hours of our jam. I went on to dial in the algorithms used to correllate the sensor data with the UI and managed to build an interface that is impressively fast and tight on the latest iPhones.</p>
