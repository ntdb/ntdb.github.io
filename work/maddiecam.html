<p>It's Maddie! She's a dog.</p>

<p>Daniel has had the opportunity to support <a href="http://theronhumphrey.com/" target="_blank">Theron Humphrey</a> in his work over the last few years. In addition to building websites for his various projects we also took the chance to immortalize his dog, Maddie the Coonhound, in her own iPhone app.</p>

<p>Maddie is known for her excellent balance and her patience in standing on things while waiting for Theron to photograph her. MaddieCam allows fans to superimpose one of several images of Maddie on their own things (or friends). I implemented the designs for the app using Cocoa Touch and Objective-C. I also contributed to the development and refining of the camera implementation.</p>
