<p>Perception was a class project at Georgia Tech. As the capstone of a series of three projects in an Interaction Design course, Perception was intended to showcase a game as an interactive medium. It was not necessary that the game be digital but, being predisposed to such things, I managed to steer my group in that direction.</p>

<p>We started with the idea of manipulating light. We weren’t sure exactly where that would take us: we discussed near/far sightedness, blindness, color blindness, prisms, and more. After doing some paper prototyping and developing level ideas we settled on a simple mechanic: the player possesses a mirror that allows them to reflect a given beam of light in eight directions. There exist “absORBs” (my cheesy name for them) in the game’s short levels that, once lit, continue to produce a new beam of light. This allows the player to move through and around obstacles.</p>

<p>One of my favorite design decisions is the omission of doors. The player is free to move through the game as they please. The darkness of the cave, however, prevents them from navigating the levels or even knowing where their character is. There are no physical barriers preventing progression, only the player’s blindness. They must guide the light through the opening at the end of each stage to illuminate the next.</p>
