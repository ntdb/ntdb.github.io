<p>Sync was a class project at Georgia Tech. The goal was to develop and release a fully playable and fun game over the course of one spring semester. We used several playtesting sessions to refine the game play and came up with a unique kind of local multiplayer game.</p>

<p>Aptly described by our professor as a "Reverse Turing Test", Sync has one of two players attempt to match the actions of a set of AI units while the second player tries to determine which unit is human-controlled. The "impostor" is given the opportunity to learn both the (simple, physics-driven) control scheme and the actions they must mimic.</p>

<p>Technically, Sync was an exercise in physics programming, user input design, and tools programming. I was the architect and primary programmer on the project. As part of that role I built a text-based level design tool which would interperet level files at runtime. This allowed my teammates to design levels and tweak them without needing to rebuild the game.</p>

<p>Grand plans to implement networking (presumably through Player.io) never panned out. I did, however, later use Sync as the basis for an AI-centric project in which one player attempted to follow the movements of AI units for as long as possible.</p>
