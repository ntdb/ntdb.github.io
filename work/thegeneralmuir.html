<p>The General Muir opened up at Emory Point in Atlanta in late 2012. Daniel was commisioned to build a dynamic and responsive site to showcase their menu and their unique approach to the NYC Jewish deli in Atlanta. In addition to a responsive front end we also built an integrated content management system that enables real-time content changes using the power of Meteor.</p>
