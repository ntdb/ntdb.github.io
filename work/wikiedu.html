<p>In December of 2014 I began working on version one of the Wiki Edu Dashboard. This project is all about enabling university instructors to use Wikipedia as part of their course curriculum. I focused on writing readable, tested, and well-documented code for this application and had the joy of seeing it live on far past the end of my involvement.</p>

<p>Over the course of my eight-month stint with this project I approaced the application from many different angles: architecting, front end development, back end development, database administration, server administration, UX design, performance optimization, unit testing, integration testing, client relations, project management, and more.</p>
