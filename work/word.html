<p>Word (a... working title) is a side project I started at the end of 2013 in an effort to strengthen my C++ knowledge and to publish a game with a small scope.</p>

<p>Two local players are given a square board with an array of tiles, each facing either one player or the other. In each turn a player may rotate a tile to face themself or swap two tiles before being given a chance to spell a word using their tiles.</p>

<p>Although the core gameplay is finished (and enjoyable), I'm in the process of adding more fun elements to the game's design. Inspired by games like <a href="http://fingleforipad.com/" target="_blank">Fingle</a> and <a href="http://secret-library.com/project/centrifeud/" target="_blank">Centrifeud</a>, my hope is to build fun and engaging local interactions between the two players.</p>
